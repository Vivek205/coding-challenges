# Week 34 challenge

Write a function `mostValuable` which takes in a sentence and returns the first instance of word which is the most valuable.
Words value is calculated by summing up points for each letter.

Each letter scores points based on its position in the alphabet. A = 1, B = 2... etc.
Case does not matter when assigning points to letters.

*Note:* Only latin alphabet characters get points. Punctuation and all other symbols get 0 points.


Examples:
```
mostValuable('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog') // return 'jumps'
mostValuable('The quick jUmPs brown fox jumps over the lazy dog') // return 'jUmPs'
mostValuable('Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz') // return 'quartz'
mostValuable('You go tell that vapid existentialist quack Freddy Nietzsche that he can just bite me twice') // return 'existentialist'
```
